1) 
import time
print("Hello World")
time.sleep(300)

2)
run main.py file
run below comands
ps -a

3)
run a python file
run below comands to see process states
ps -a | grep "R" (in Running state)
ps -a | grep "S" (in sleep)
ps -aus (all process with state info)

4)
create process with different sleep timers to see this

Ques-> How does the operating system decide which process gets CPU time? What
role does the process scheduler play in this?

A scheduling method is used to decide which job will be dispatched for execution.

Process schedulers are fundamental components of operating systems responsible for deciding the order in which processes are executed by the CPU. 
In simpler terms, they manage how the CPU allocates its time among multiple tasks or processes that are competing for its attention. 
Process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process based on a particular strategy.
can use Round Robin, SJF(preemtive, non preemtive) etc
