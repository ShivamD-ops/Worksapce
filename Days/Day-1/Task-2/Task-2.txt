HTTPS is HTTP with encryption and verification. 
The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses, 
and to digitally sign those requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. 
A website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://.

 HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it uses encryption to protect information as it is being sent 
between clients and servers. When an organization enables HTTPS, any information you transmit, 
like passwords or credit card numbers, will be difficult for anyone to intercept.

The Purpose of SSL/TLS Certificates->
SSL/TLS certificates serve three primary functions: encryption, authentication, and trust.

1) Encryption ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remains private and integral. 
This is crucial for protecting sensitive information like login credentials, credit card details, and personal 
data from interception.

2) Authentication verifies that your website is who it claims to be, preventing impersonation attempts. 
This involves validating your domain ownership and, in some cases, your organization’s identity.

3) Trust is fostered with website visitors by showing them you value their privacy and security. 
Visible indicators like the padlock icon and HTTPS in the URL reassure users that their connection is secure.
