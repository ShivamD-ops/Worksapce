Opposed to OAuth, Basic Authentication is a more straightforward, yet less secure method embedded within the HTTP framework. It involves transmitting a username and password with every request, often encoded in Base64. This method, while simple, risks exposing user credentials more openly.

FEATURE	        OAUTH	                                        BASIC AUTHENTICATION
Security Level	High, indirect exposure of credentials.	        Lower, credentials are sent with each request.
User Control	Extensive, with scope and time limitations.	Minimal, full credential access is provided.
Complexity	Higher, due to token management.	        Lower, straightforward credential encoding.
Ideal Usage	Suited for services requiring secure, delegated access.	Best for basic, direct authentication needs.



JWTs are self-contained and carry all the necessary information, which eliminates the need for a server-side session store. Scalability: Being stateless, JWTs are easily scalable across multiple servers as there's no need to share session data.
