DNS servers translate the website domain names users search in web browsers into corresponding numerical IP addresses. 
This process is known as DNS resolution. 

The Domain Name System (DNS) allows users to access websites using domain names and URLs 
rather than complex numerical internet protocol (IP) addresses.

The host requests the DNS name server to resolve the domain name. 
And the name server returns the IP address corresponding to that domain 
name to the host so that the host can future connect to that IP address.



The working of DNS starts with converting a hostname into an IP Address. 
A domain name serves as a distinctive identification for a website. 
It is used in place of an IP address to make it simpler for consumers to visit websites. 
Domain Name System works by executing the database whose work is to store the name of hosts 
which are available on the Internet. 
The top-level domain server stores address information for top-level domains such as .com and .net, .org, and so on. 
If the Client sends the request, then the DNS resolver sends a request to DNS Server to fetch the IP Address. 
In case, when it does not contain that particular IP Address with a hostname, it forwards the request to another DNS Server. 
When IP Address has arrived at the resolver, it completes the request over Internet Protocol .
